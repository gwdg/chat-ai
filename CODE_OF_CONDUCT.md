# Chat AI Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge

We, as contributors, maintainers, and community members, pledge to foster a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone. We commit to making participation in our working group a harassment-free experience for all—regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or technical background.

We strive to build a collaborative, innovative, and inclusive space for delivering AI and large language model (LLM) tools powered by our secure and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive and productive community include:

- Showing empathy, courtesy, and kindness to others

- Respecting diverse perspectives, experiences, and technical opinions

- Giving and receiving constructive feedback graciously

- Acknowledging and correcting mistakes, and learning from them

- Prioritizing collaboration and the collective good over individual gain

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances

- Trolling, derogatory remarks, or personal attacks

- Harassment or intimidation in any form, in public or private spaces

- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., contact details) without permission

- Disruptive behavior in meetings, code reviews, or community discussions

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all official working group spaces, including Matrix channels, mailing lists, video meetings, Git repositories, documentation platforms, and any events or conferences where the group is represented.

It also extends to interactions where individuals represent the community in public settings (e.g., presentations, open-source events, or social media).

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported confidentially to the working group leadership team via direct **message/email to "?"**. All concerns will be reviewed and addressed promptly, respectfully, and fairly.

We are committed to protecting the identity and safety of reporters.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Our community leaders will apply the following guidelines when determining the consequences of unacceptable behavior:

**1. Correction**

Consequence: A private, written warning and clarification of expectations. A public apology may be requested when appropriate.
